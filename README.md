An entry to the [Repositories Fringe 14](http://www.repositoryfringe.org/) Developer Challenge by [Rory McNicholl](https://github.com/cziaarm), [Paul Mucur](https://github.com/mudge) and [Richard Wincewicz](https://github.com/rwincewicz).

This is a small API that, given article metadata in the form of ePrints JSON,
will consult various different services (see below) to pull as much missing
data as possible.

##Â Usage

Post your article metadata as JSON to `/validate` to receive metadata in return:

```console
$ curl localhost:4567/validate -d '{ "title": "Revisiting the River Skerne: the long-term social benefits of river rehabilitation" }'
```

Will return:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    "Publisher field is missing",
    "ISSN field is missing",
    "Publication field is missing",
    "DOI field is missing",
    "Funders field is missing",
    "Creators field is missing"
  ],
  "dois": [
    {
      "title": "Revisiting the River Skerne: The long-term social benefits of river rehabilitation",
      "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.01.009"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Accepted fields

The input format to this API is based on [EPrints](http://www.eprints.org/)
JSON export and, as such, supports the following fields:

```javascript
{
  "creators": [
    {
      "name": {
        "given": "Joe",
        "family": "Bloggs"
      }
    }
  ],
  "title": "Some great article",
  "publisher": "Publishing House",
  "id_number": "10.1234/test",
  "publication": "A great publication",
  "issn": "1234-5678"
}
```

It will return a list of possible field values in the following format:

```javascript
{
    "errors": [
        "Publisher field is missing"
    ],
    "funders": [],
    "dois": [
        {
            "title": "foo",
            "doi": "http: //dx.doi.org/10.1234/test"
        }
    ],
    "title": [
        "Foo bar"
    ],
    "issn": [
        "1234-5678"
    ],
    "publishers": [
        {
            "name": "Publisher"
        }
    ],
    "publications": [
        {
            "title": "Journal name",
            "issn": "1234-5678"
        }
    ],
    "volume": [
        "113"
    ],
    "page": [
        "94-103"
    ],
    "authors": [
        {
            "family": "Bloggs",
            "given": "Joe"
        }
    ],
    "subjects": [
        "Management"
